-- CTEs: common table expressions. alter
-- they allow you to define a subquery block that cna be referenced in the main query
-- with is the keybword to define a CTE
-- CTEs are unique because you can only use a CTE immediately after you create it
-- Subqueries can be used in a WHERE clause in conjunction with the keywords IN or EXISTS, but you can't do this with CTEs.

WITH CTE_Example AS
(
SELECT gender, AVG(salary) as avg_sal, MAX(salary) as max_sal, min(salary) min_sal, count(salary) count
from employee_demographics dem
join employee_salary sal
	on dem. employee_id =  sal.employee_id
Group by gender
)

SELECT AVG(avg_sal)
FROM CTE_Example
;

WITH CTE_Example (Gender, Avg_sal, Max_sal, Min_sal, Count_sal) AS
-- overriding the alias
(
SELECT gender, AVG(salary) as avg_sal, MAX(salary) as max_sal, min(salary) min_sal, count(salary) count
from employee_demographics dem
join employee_salary sal
	on dem. employee_id =  sal.employee_id
Group by gender
)

SELECT *
FROM CTE_Example
;

-- Difference between a subquery and a CTE
-- a bank holds details of all the transactions for the day in a table called daily_trans. The data in this table includes an account number, a transaction code, and an amount.
-- The database also has a table called transaction_types, and its columns include the transaction code and an indicator called debit_credit, which is set to 1 for transaction types that credit the customer's account, and 2 for those that debit the account.
-- If the bank wants a list of all credit transactions for the day, the query could look like this:
SELECT
  account_no,
  tran_code,
  amount
FROM daily_trans
WHERE tran_code IN
  (SELECT tran_code
   FROM transaction_types
   WHERE debit_credit = 1);
-- This type of query can only be written using a subquery. You couldnâ€™t replace the subquery with a CTE here.

-- Choose a subquery when:

-- You're using the WHERE clause keywords IN or EXISTS to pick up the selection criteria from another table.
-- You want to select a single piece of data from another table as the new value for a field in an UPDATE statement.
